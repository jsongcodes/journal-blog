# The Journal Blog

The Journal Blog is a journaling app for people who love to journal on the go.

## Description

This journal blog web app was made for people who love to journal, but don't quite have time to. This web app allows them to journal on-the-go using quick prompts, see their previous entries, and to keep track of their thoughts. This web app has a Home component containing a button that leads them to the New Entry component. The New Entry component has different prompts that the user can choose from. The user can answer the prompt in the body and select the date. Then their entry is posted onto the Past Entries component. Once on the Past Entries component, the user can read past entries. The user can go back to the Home component by clicking on the Journal Blog header.
