# The Journal Blog

This journal blog web app was made for people who love to journal, but don't quite have time to. This web app allows them to journal on-the-go using quick prompts, see their previous entries, and to keep track of their thoughts. This web app has a Home component containing a button that leads them to the Create component. The Create component has different prompts that the user can choose from. The user can answer the prompt in the body and select the date. Then their entry is posted onto the Entry List component. Once on the Entry List component, the user can select an entry to read and can also delete entries using a button. Once the entry is deleted, the user is led back to the Entry List component and can go back to the Home component by clicking on the Journal Blog header.

I created a db.json file to list the previous entries.

I utilized React to make the page more dynamic. I used props, state, and useEffect.

I utilized CSS to make the website more user friendly.
